## Rules

Congratulations! You are now the newest employee of the greatest diner in the world! We are proud to have you on our team.
Your goal is simple, tend to the customers who come in the restruant.
You need to seat them, take their order, and give them their check (sort of like diner dash, but better!).
Here are a couple things to note:

- Every customer who comes in is thirsty and hungry
- Their thirst and hunger levels will be added to your stress levels
- You can serve them whenever you like and give them a check whenever you like!
- Giving them food makes you and them less stressed
- Checking them out makes you and them less stressed AND if you served them, it gives you money!
- The TRICK is that you do not know how hungry or thirsty they are
- OR how much money they are going to spend
- The only way to figure these things out is to ask them
- But once you ask, or serve them, or check them out, BE READY!
- Another customer is already at the door.
- If you get too stressed or the restruant gets too full, it's GAME OVER!




### Starting up

First, you will be asked in a prompt whether or not you have played the game before.
If you have played before:
- Good news! We can probably find your info and you can try to beat your high score.
If this is your first time playing:
- You will have to create a username.
- Then, you will be asked if you would like the rules explained.

Now the game begins...
